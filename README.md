# Voice-Command-Todo-List
This is a Python-based voice-controlled to-do list app. Users can add, delete, or view tasks through voice commands using `speech_recognition` and receive voice feedback via `pyttsx3`. Text-based prompts for deleting tasks are provided by `InquirerPy`. The app listens for commands like "Add task," "Delete task," "View tasks," or "Exit."
